I'm thrilled to share my first complete React project! While I'm proud of the progress I've made, I'm also aware of areas where I can improve.

One of my main focuses in this project was on managing the services used by the application, particularly to enhance my skills in this area and handle potential issues effectively. I structured the service folder to make it easier to manage and abstract services, ensuring flexibility for future changes.

Handling local storage was another important aspect, especially for managing tokens within the chosen API framework. This experience taught me a lot about data management best practices in web development.

I also went beyond the basics by exploring additional React hooks like useNavigate, which added more depth to my understanding and allowed for better navigation within the app.

One of the challenges I faced was in styling with CSS, an area where I feel I need more practice. However, I see this as an opportunity to grow my skills and plan to focus on it in the coming weeks.

While I'm not completely satisfied with the project, it has been incredibly valuable for my learning journey. I see it as a work-in-progress that will continue to evolve alongside my growing skills.

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience, and I'm excited to continue improving and building upon it in the future.
